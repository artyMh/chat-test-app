# Technical test

### How to launch
* Server `cd server && npm install && npm run start:dev`
* Client `cd client && npm install && npm run start`

### About
Everything made from scratch, without any help of starter packs.
Some things wasn't described properly, such as logging solution or configuration, so I implememnted these stuff as I understood it.
Also it was made in 4 evenings(lack of time), so possibly there will be some code which you can not like + undiscovered bugs. Sorry for that.

## Room to grow (lack of time)
* <strike>Re-write server on TypeScript</strike>
* Use linter on frontend side
* Use `prop-types` package at client
